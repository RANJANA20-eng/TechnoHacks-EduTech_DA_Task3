# Introduction :
A histogram is a graphical representation of data points organized into user-specified ranges. Similar in appearance to a bar graph, the histogram condenses a data series into an easily interpreted visual by taking many data points and grouping them into logical ranges or bins. 
# Histograms vs. Bar Charts 
Histograms are commonly used in statistics to demonstrate how many of a certain type of variable occur within a specific range. Both histograms and bar charts provide a visual display using columns, and people often use the terms interchangeably. Technically, however, a histogram represents the frequency distribution of variables in a data set. A bar graph typically represents a graphical comparison of discrete or categorical variables. The histogram displays the distribution frequency as a two-dimensional figure, meaning the height and width of columns or rectangles have particular meanings and can both vary. A bar chart is a one-dimensional figure. The height of its bars represent something specific. The width of the bars has no meaning. On a histogram, there are no gaps between columns. Column width changes as the variable represented changes. On bar charts, the bars usually have gaps between them.
